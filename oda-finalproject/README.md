> Nuxt.js project

Authors: Sierra Lorenzini, Rikki Kendall, Charlotte Roh

Notes (Sierra):
In general I am happy with how this website turned out. I learned a lot about Vue, Nuxt, and Firebase and feel
more comfortable now developing a more complex website. I worked pretty hard to implement user authorization and authentication (users and admins can donate, admins can add projects to projects page) and the dual language functionality through a Vuex store. Nuxt took a lot of trial and error to figure out but in the end it was nice to generate a static website espeically considering this page is meant to be more informational than a dynamic application.

One thing that still isn't working (and I have no idea why) is the image carousel on the Why page. It is there, but only shows up when you click on the big white area. This is particilarly strange considering Rikki
used my exact code just modified for different data in the Why page and it works perfectly there. I tried posting on Piazza and doing a lot of research but couldn't figure out how to fix it.

Notes (Rikki): 
I had an incredible experience with this website development. The organization that the group had planning out each section and having a great time with it really. On a personal level, I got to sum up all of the things we learned throughout the semester and put them all together. I learned an incredible amount about Nuxtjs and how it makes it easier to employ Vue and integrate many features into the website. The bilingual aspect of the site was also another great feature of our website that was interesting to implement. From the site header and footer, the About page, Why page, and every other feature of the website we got to collaborate on, I definitely learned an incredible amount and really hope that this website does eventually get utilized for the ODA.
