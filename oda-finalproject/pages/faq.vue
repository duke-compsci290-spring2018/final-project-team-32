        <div slot="header"><b>EDUCATION</b>: What do I need to do in order to attend a “Bachillerato” or to take a “High School” equivalency exam?</div>
        <v-card>
          <v-card-text>
            <p>You will need a “Certificado de Terminación de Estudios de Educación
              Secundaria” (either a diploma from a Mexican school or a revalidated
              diploma/transcripts from the United States) in order to apply for a
              Bachillerato, to apply for the Prepa Abierta, or to take one of the high
              school equivalency exams.</p>

            <p>At this time, you CANNOT revalidate your Middle School studies without
              already being enrolled in a SECONDARY SCHOOL. If you are over 18 years old,
              that is likely not an option for you. Furthermore, because Mexico’s Primary
              School system requires six years (the equivalent of 1st-6th grades) and the
              Middle School system requires three years (the equivalent of 7th, 8th, and
              9th grades) you will need to have completed the first year of high school
              in order to apply for total revalidation of MIDDLE SCHOOL. If you did not
              finish 9th grade, technically you should be able to apply for a partial
              revalidation of your Middle School education. Although the G.E.D. is
              recognized widely in the United States and Canada, the SEP does NOT currently
              recognize or revalidate a G.E.D. exam from the US.</p>

            <p>To learn more about the SEP Revalidation Process:
              <a href="http://www.sincree.sep.gob.mx/es/sincree/EDUCACIO_BASICA http://www.sincree.sep.gob.mx/es/sincree/EDUCACIO_BASICA">Click here.</a>
              Given the current bureaucratic obstacles to partial and full revalidation of
              a US-based PRIMARY and MIDDLE SCHOOL education as an adult, you are better
              off NOT revalidating anything and starting from scratch. Deep breath!
              Hang in there!</p>

            <p><b>OPTION ONE</b>: The National Institute for Adult Education (INEA)
              has a system for Primary and Secondary Education for Adults. The INEA
              does not currently accept your Primary or Secondary transcripts from the
              United States, and the SEP does not currently revalidate those transcripts.
              So, you must study for and take all 12 units for Primary School certification
              and all 12 units for Secondary School certification. You will need to visit a
              Plaza Comunitaria near you (in the US or in Mexico, de hecho), although in
              some cases you can eventually take each unit exam online. If you have proof
              of studies in Mexico for any year of your Primary or Secondary education,
              INEA will give you credit for the equivalent units. There is no cost. Sam
              and Jorge report the process taking two to three months. On the positive
              side, you can practice your Spanish!</p>

            <p>To learn more about the INEA and to find a Plaza Comunitaria near
              you (in the United States or in Mexico): <a href="http://www.inea.gob.mx/index.php http://www.inea.gob.mx/index.php">Click here.</a>
            </p>

            <p><b>OPTION TWO</b>: The Centro Nacional de Evaluación para la Educación
              Superior, A.C., known as CENEVAL, provides equivalency exams for Secondary
              School and High School, as well as some University Degrees. You can take
              the exam entitled “ACREDITA-SEC” or the “Examen de Acreditación de Conocimientos
              Equivalentes a la Educación Secundaria con Base en el Acuerdo 286.”
              You must be over 15 years old, have an authorized Certificate of Completion
              of Primary Education (again, this probably only works for those who graduated
              from Primary School in Mexico). Its costs 431 pesos, and you have to
              find an institution that administers CENEVAL exams near you (ojo, we could
              not find this information on the website!). Within ODA we do not know anyone
              who has taken this exam. If you know something more, please let us know!</p>

            <p>To learn more about CENEVAL and these exams:

      <div slot="header"><b>EDUCATION</b>: How can I re-validate my K-12 education from the United States or another country?</div>
      <v-card>
        <v-card-text>
          <p>So, “revalidation” is a process by which the Mexican Secretariat of
            Education (the SEP) recognizes the validity of your education documents
            from the United States and your adequate preparation to continue studying
            in Mexico. As of June 2015, you NO LONGER need an international apostille
            on each of the documents and YOU can translate the documents from English to
            Spanish yourself and/or look for any translator (not necessarily an official
            government translator).</p>

          <p>(If you or your siblings were born in the United States, you will most
            likely need an international apostille and official translation
            (“por perrito”) of your birth certificate.)</p>

          <p>You will need the originals, one copy, and the translations of the following documents:<br>
            •	The application (pick one up at the designated SEP office)<br>
            •	Birth certificate or other identification document<br>
            •	Your elementary, middle school, and high school diploma. Some offices ask for all three, so best to be prepared. Although officially, and hopefully in most cases, you will only need your most recent diploma and the one before it.<br>
            •	Your full transcripts of the highest degree attained. For example, if you are trying to revalidate your high school education, you will need your high school transcripts.<br>
            •	Bank receipt of payment (pick up the form from local SEP office)<br>
            •	Any other supporting documents from your high school that you can provide re: the plan and study program: grades, requirements, electives etc.

            or income nor present periodic declarations. The process can be done through the
            SAT website. Before you used to only be ableto do it in person at the nearest SAT
            delegation, but now you can do it via internet. In order to get your RFC on line,
            you will need: <i>your curp</i>. Fill out the electronic application which is

      <v-card>
        <v-card-text>
          <p>A birth certificate is a legal document that certifies the physical origin of an individual. The process usually begins with a certificate of birth issued by the hospital/doctor/midwife when the infant was born. The certificate is then taken to the local civil registry office (“Registro Civil”) in order for the infant to be certified as a citizen.</p>

          <p>There are three options to obtain an official copy of a Mexican birth certificate. In most cases you will need to visit the local civil registry office where you or the person was registered, except if you use the kiosk option and/or if the civil register has an updated website.</p>

          <p>For more information, <a href="http://www.registro-civil.com.mx/acta-nacimiento">click</a> the link to check if you can request your birth certificate online visit.

          <p>If you need to register your Mexican nationality or the nationality of your children (people born in the United States to one or more Mexican parent have the constitutional right to Mexican citizenship), you need to go to your local “registro civil” with an original birth certificate (from the United States, or another country) and the parent’s birth certificate and identification.</p>

          <p>If you need to register your birth in Mexico but you were not registered at birth, you will need an extemporaneous birth certificate. You can find our more information <a href="http://www.tramitesyservicios.df.gob.mx/wb/TyS/levantamiento_de_acta_de_nacimiento_extemporane">here</a> (This website provides information about the government process in Mexico City, other states have different modules and offices).</p>

          <p>If you are having trouble with the process, you can contact ODA, IMUMI, or the Be Foundation for more information about your rights to (bi)national identity.</p>

          <p>All children of Mexican nationals have the constitutional right to Mexican citizenship. No one needs to renounce any other citizenship, by birth or otherwise. Binational citizenship provides currently important protections in both countries.</p>

          <p>If you need to register your Mexican nationality or the nationality of your children, you need to go to your local “registro civil” with an original birth certificate (from the United States, or another country) and the parent’s birth certificate and identification.</p>

          <p>For more information, click <a href="http://www.registro-civil.com.mx/acta-nacimiento">here</a> to check if you can request your birth certificate online visit.
