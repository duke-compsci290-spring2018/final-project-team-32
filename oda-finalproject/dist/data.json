        "description": "This project supports those who cannot legally travel across international borders between their homes due to return, bans, and/or deportations. We sponsor the application for an Otr@ dreamer to apply for a b1/b2 visa and travel to the United States to advocate for dreamers in Mexico while there. The majority of deported and returning youth live with three, ten, twenty, and up to lifetime bans from legal re-entry to the US. They live in exile. On these trips, we build awareness and coalitions around the urgent reforms to the 1996 IIRIRA law that established these unjust bans. #‎retroactive96 We are also conducting an on-going research effort to record the experiences of immigrant youth who apply for a b1/b2 visa at the US embassy and offices in Mexico. If you would like to learn more about the #FIX96 project or you have a story about your visa application, positive or negative, please get in touch with us!",

        "description": "'Bienvenid@ a #MexicoLindoyHerido' is a project we have been doing for some time, although until now, without a name. We want to continue to offer students abroad, including but not limited to DACA recipients, the welcome many of us did not receive upon arriving to our birth country.  After deportation and return, we have learned about Mexico in all her beauty and her challenges. We are a part of the transformation happening in this country, but only because we recognize all the ways that injustice, violence, and discrimination are rampant. If you are planning a delegation, or you are from a delegation of students that will be visiting, please contact us and we can coordinate presentations, dialogues and other activities throughout Mexico. We can also coordinate group Skype presentations/conversations before or ater your trip. This is also an opportunity to participate in economic solidarity, as we ask for travel expenses (when necessary) and an honorarium to support ODA. We can coordinate events in English, Spanish, Spanglish, or all three.",

Dreamers in Mexico can participate in twelve weeks of virtual therapy at no cost, with the possibility to continue for another twelve weeks when necessary. In specific cases, support is also extended to family members on both sides of the border.
